Module 2 Graded Assessment

1. Complete the function by filling in the missing parts. The color_translator function receives the name of a color, then prints its hexadecimal value. Currently, it only supports the three additive primary colors (red, green, blue), so it returns "unknown" for all other colors.

ans:- 

def color_translator(color):
	if color == "red":
		hex_color = "#ff0000"
	elif color == "green":
		hex_color = "#00ff00"
	elif color == "blue":
		hex_color = "#0000ff"
	else :
		hex_color = "unknown"
	return hex_color

print(color_translator("blue")) # Should be #0000ff
print(color_translator("yellow")) # Should be unknown
print(color_translator("red")) # Should be #ff0000
print(color_translator("black")) # Should be unknown
print(color_translator("green")) # Should be #00ff00
print(color_translator("")) # Should be unknown

2.What's the value of this Python expression: "big" > "small"
ans:-
False

3.What is the elif keyword used for?
ans:- 
To handle more than two comparison cases

4.Students in a class receive their grades as Pass/Fail. Scores of 60 or more (out of 100) mean that the grade is "Pass". For lower scores, the grade is "Fail". In addition, scores above 95 (not included) are graded as "Top Score". Fill in this function so that it returns the proper grade.

ans:- 

def exam_grade(score):
	if score> 95:
		grade = "Top Score"
	elif score>= 60:
		grade = "Pass"
	else:
		grade = "Fail"
	return grade

print(exam_grade(65)) # Should be Pass
print(exam_grade(55)) # Should be Fail
print(exam_grade(60)) # Should be Pass
print(exam_grade(95)) # Should be Pass
print(exam_grade(100)) # Should be Top Score
print(exam_grade(0)) # Should be Fail

5. What's the value of this Python expression: 11 % 5?
ans:- 1

6.

ans:- 
def format_name(first_name, last_name):
	# code goes here
 if(first_name!="" and last_name!=""):
    string = "Name: "+last_name+", "+first_name
 elif(first_name=="" and last_name==""):
    string = ""
 else:
    string = "Name: "+first_name+last_name
 return string   
 
print(format_name("Ernest", "Hemingway")) 
    
# Should return the string "Name: Hemingway, Ernest"

print(format_name("", "Madonna"))
# Should return the string "Name: Madonna"

print(format_name("Voltaire", ""))
# Should return the string "Name: Voltaire"

print(format_name("", ""))
# Should return an empty string

7. The longest_word function is used to compare 3 words. It should return the word with the most number of characters (and the first in the list when they have the same length). Fill in the blank to make this happen.

ans:- 
def longest_word(word1, word2, word3):
	if len(word1) >= len(word2) and len(word1) >= len(word3):
		word = word1
	elif len(word2) >= len(word1) and len(word2) >= len(word3):
		word = word2
	else:
		word = word3
	return(word)

print(longest_word("chair", "couch", "table"))
print(longest_word("bed", "bath", "beyond"))
print(longest_word("laptop", "notebook", "desktop"))

8.What’s the output of this code?
def sum(x, y):
		return(x+y)
print(sum(sum(1,2), sum(3,4)))

ans:- 10

9.What's the value of this Python expression?

((10 >= 5*2) and (10 <= 5*2))

ans:- True

10.The fractional_part function divides the numerator by the denominator, and returns just the fractional part (a number between 0 and 1). Complete the body of the function so that it returns the right number. Note: Since division by 0 produces an error, if the denominator is 0, the function should return 0 instead of attempting the division.

ans:- 

def fractional_part(numerator, denominator):
  if(numerator==0 or denominator==0):
    return 0
  else:
    fract= (numerator/denominator)-(numerator//denominator)
    return fract
	# Operate with numerator and denominator to 
# keep just th
print(fractional_part(5, 5)) # Should be 0
print(fractional_part(5, 4)) # Should be 0.25
print(fractional_part(5, 3)) # Should be 0.66...
print(fractional_part(5, 2)) # Should be 0.5
print(fractional_part(5, 0)) # Should be 0
print(fractional_part(0, 5)) # Should be 0
