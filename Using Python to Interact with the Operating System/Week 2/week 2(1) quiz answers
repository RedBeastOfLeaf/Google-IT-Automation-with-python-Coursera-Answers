Practice Quiz: Managing Files & Directories

1.The new_directory function creates a new directory inside the current working directory, then creates a new empty file inside the new directory, and returns the list of files in that directory. Fill in the gaps to create a file "script.py" in the directory "PythonPrograms".

ANS:- 

import os

def new_directory(directory, filename):
  # Before creating a new directory, check to see if it already exists
  if not os.path.exists(directory):
    os.mkdir(directory)
    name=os.path.join(directory, filename)
    file=open(name,'w')
    file.close()
  return os.listdir(directory)

  # Create the new file inside of the new directory

  # Return the list of files in the new directory

print(new_directory("PythonPrograms", "script.py"))


2.Which of the following methods from the os module will create a new directory?
ANS:- mkdir()

3.The file_date function creates a new file in the current working directory, checks the date that the file was modified, and returns just the date portion of the timestamp in the format of yyyy-mm-dd. Fill in the gaps to create a file called "newfile.txt" and check the date that it was modified.

ANS':-

import os
import datetime

def file_date(filename):
  # Create the file in the current directory
  with open (filename,'w') as file:
    pass
  timestamp = os.path.getmtime(filename)
  c=datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)
  # Convert the timestamp into a readable format, then into a string
 
  # Return just the date portion 
  # Hint: how many characters are in “yyyy-mm-dd”? 
  return ("{}".format(c.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")))

print(file_date("newfile.txt")) 
# Should be today's date in the format of yyyy-mm-dd

4.The parent_directory function returns the name of the directory that's located just above the current working directory. Remember that '..' is a relative path alias that means "go up to the parent directory". Fill in the gaps to complete this function.

ANS:- 

import os
def parent_directory():

  # Create a relative path to the parent 
  # of the current working directory 
  relative_parent = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), os.pardir)
  # Return the absolute path of the parent directory
  return os.path.abspath(relative_parent)

print(parent_directory())
